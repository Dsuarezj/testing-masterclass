# Bulletproof Code: Automated Testing Strategies for Agile Developers

This repository contains the practical part of the master class "Bulletproof Code: Automated Testing Strategies for Agile Developers." It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and serves as a simple example to learn different types of tests and tools using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Overview

In this project, we will create a simple text filtering application. This will involve creating some buttons and other UI elements to practice writing different types of tests, including unit tests, component tests, integration test, and functional tests. We will use TDD to drive the development process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.10.0 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this project, you will learn how to:

- Write and run unit tests, component tests, and functional tests.
- Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.
- Use testing tools and libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library.

## Exercises

- checkout to `solution` branch
- Add an e2e test that check if the button `Send to warehouse` works and that is empty the basket after it is clicked
- Add a component test that checks if the button `Send to warehouse` is disabled when the basket is empty and implement it
- Add a component test that checks if the button `Send to warehouse` and the response is correct then empty the basket
- Add a component test that checks if the button `Send to warehouse` and the response fails then the basket is not empty and the error message is displayed, and implement it.
